         <h3>India has a rich heritage of gold mining, albeit on a small scale</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="col-6 mt-3">
        <p>The geology of the Indian Peninsula (South of the Himalayas) is predominantly made up of four Archaean cratons, Proterozoic belts, and sedimentary basins alongside the much younger basalts of the Deccan traps. The Dharwar craton, in the south of India, is the most significant geological formation for gold mineralisation, with lesser occurrences also identified in the other Archaean cratons and Proterozoic units in the country. Gold mining in India dates back to the first millennium BC and throughout the twentieth century was dominated by the Kolar Gold Field, near Bangalore. The field is hosted within the Kolar Greenstone Belt, a 3-6km wide by 80 km long band of greenstone geology – a terrain similar to that which hosts many of the world’s most significant gold discoveries. The Belt predominantly lies along the southeast edge of the state of Karnataka, but also under parts of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu (Figure 1).</p>

        <p>The Kolar Gold Field closed in 2001, having produced more than 800t of gold during its 120-year history.1 During its first two decades of operation (1884-1904) the average grade of the ore produced from shallow underground working was an impressive 45g/t, while over its total life span the average ore grade was 15g/t. By comparison, gold grades from South Africa’s prolific Witwatersrand Basin averaged around 9g/t over a similar time frame.2</p>
        <p>In subsequent years, gold was primarily extracted from three mines within the East Kolar region: Champion, Mysore and Nundydoorg. By the late 1990s, however, mining had become uneconomic due to reducing grades and increasing costs, and the Kolar operations were finally abandoned in 2001. By this point production had reportedly reached a depth of 3,200m (one of the deepest gold mines in the world), while workings stretched along a 7.3km strike and included 100 shafts and 1,400km of underground development.3</p>

        <p>The other significant gold producer in India has been the Hutti Gold Mine, located in the Raichur district of Karnataka.4 The operation initially entered production in 1902, although it subsequently closed in 1918 because of a paucity of funds due to World War I. Since its restart in 1947, through to 2020, it has produced some 84t of gold and is currently the only significant gold producer in India. </p>
        <p>Ore from the main Hutti mine is now supplemented by satellite feeds from the Uti (open pit) and Hira-Buddinni (underground) deposits. Higher grade ore processed at Hutti in 2019 was responsible for boosting India’s gold output by 22% y-o-y to 1.9t; gold reserves are sufficient to support production at the current rate for another 30 years.5  </p>
        <p>Gold mining production declined marginally to 1.6t in 2020 as the mine closed in April of that year due to Covid-19</p>
        <p>Historically, gold has also been produced from other deposits, including as a by-product of domestic copper production, although these additional sources have produced limited volumes. The main source of India’s gold from other deposits is Birla Copper’s smelter at Dahej in Gujarat, which processes domestic and imported copper concentrate.6 The plant has an installed gold capacity of 15t per year, although output was below this level in 2020 at 6t.7</p>
